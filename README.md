#Spring Design spreadsheet
# Spring Calculator
I found the formulas for this calculator in a document called "springs.pdf" which can be found online using google.
The mandrel size formula is uncertain, it will give a ballpark assumption. Adjust size for the material used by trial and error.

The Spreadsheet is in Open Office Format .ods
